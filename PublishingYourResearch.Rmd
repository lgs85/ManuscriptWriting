##1. Write a paper

<br>

- Can be viewed initially as multiple small(ish) writing tasks

- You don't have to start at the beginning

- It doesn't have to be good to begin with

- You can't wait around for inspiration - you just have to get on with it







##1. Write a paper | Set up a workflow

1. Figures and tables
2. Results
3. Methods
4. Abstract
5. Introduction
6. Discussion






##1. Write a paper | Figures and tables
Figures and table should:

- Tell the story of your paper on their own
- Be informative
- Be clear
- Look nice

##1. Write a paper | Results
- Structured around the figures
- Should be ordered logically
- Avoid intepretation (unless results & discussion combined)




##1. Write a paper | Methods

Usually something like:

- Field methods / broad experimental set up
- Molecular methods / specific experimental methods
- Statistical analyses




##1. Write a paper | Abstract

- Writing before intro/discussion helps me figure out the main things I want to say

- You can send this round to main co-authors




##1. Write a paper | Introduction

- What is your question and why is it interesting?
- What has been done to addresss it?
- What is the knowledge gap?
- How are you going to fill it?




##1. Write a paper | Discussion

- Almost a "reverse" of introduction
- Start with a summary of your results
- Place findings in context of wider research
- Don't just list all the things wrong with your study
